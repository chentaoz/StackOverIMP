More specifically I'm using ways that don't involve using <code>#define</code>d constants like <code>M_PI</code>, or hard-coding the number in.</p>

<p>The program below tests the various ways I know of. The inline assembly version is, in theory, the fastest option, though clearly not portable; I've included it as a baseline to compare the other versions against. In my tests, with built-ins, the <code>4 * atan(1)</code> version is fastest on GCC 4.2, because it auto-folds the <code>atan(1)</code> into a constant. With <code>-fno-builtin</code> specified, the <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version is fastest.</p>

<p>Here's the main testing program (<code>pitimes.c</code>):</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>#include &lt;math.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;

    time1 = clock();                                                        \
    for (i = 0; i &lt; ITERS; ++i)                                             \
        diff += (x) - M_PI;                                                 \
    time2 = clock();                                                        \
    printf(""%s\t=&gt; %e, time =&gt; %f\n"", #x, diff, diffclock(time2, time1));   \
}

static inline double
diffclock(clock_t time1, clock_t time0)
{
    return (double) (time1 - time0) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
}

int
main()
{
    int i;
    clock_t time1, time2;
    double diff;

    /* Warmup. The atan2 case catches GCC's atan folding (which would
     * optimise the ``4 * atan(1) - M_PI'' to a no-op), if -fno-builtin
     * is not used. */
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))

#if defined(__GNUC__) &amp;&amp; (defined(__i386__) || defined(__amd64__))
    extern double fldpi();

    /* Actual tests start here. */
    TESTWITH(atan2(0, -1))
    TESTWITH(acos(-1))
    TESTWITH(2 * asin(1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan2(1, 1))
    TESTWITH(4 * atan(1))

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the inline assembly stuff (<code>fldpi.c</code>), noting that it will only work for x86 and x64 systems:</p>

<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>double
fldpi()
{
    double pi;
    asm(""fldpi"" : ""=t"" (pi));
    return pi;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a build script that builds all the configurations I'm testing (<code>build.sh</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m32 -o fldpi-32.o fldpi.c
gcc -O3 -Wall -c           -m64 -o fldpi-64.o fldpi.c

gcc -O3 -Wall -ffast-math  -m32 -o pitimes1-32 pitimes.c fldpi-32.o

gcc -O3 -Wall -fno-builtin -m64 -o pitimes3-64 pitimes.c fldpi-64.o -lm
</code></pre>

<p>Apart from testing between various compiler flags (I've compared 32-bit against 64-bit too, because the optimisations are different), I've also tried switching the order of the tests around. The <code>atan2(0, -1)</code> version still comes out top every time, though.</p>

<p>AS3 uses a non-deterministic garbage collection. Which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it (typically not unless there's a reason to run, since it's an expensive operation to execute). This is the same approach used by most modern garbage collected languages (like C# and Java as well).</p>

<p>Assuming there are no other references to the memory pointed to by <code>byteArray</code> or the items within the array itself, the memory will be freed at some point after you exit the scope where <code>byteArray</code> is declared.</p>

<p>You can force a garbage collection, though you really shouldn't. If you do, do it only for testing... if you do it in production, you'll hurt performance much more than help it.</p>

<p>To force a GC, try (yes, twice):</p>

<pre><code>flash.system.System.gc();
flash.system.System.gc();
</code></pre>

<p>Draw a square, and inscribe a quadrant (one quarter of a semi-circle) inside that square (a quadrant with radius equal to the side of the square, so it fills as much of the square as possible)</p>

<p>Now throw a dart at the square, and record where it lands -- that is, choose a random point anywhere inside the square. Of course, it landed inside the square, but is it inside the semi-circle? Record this fact.</p>

<p>Repeat this process many times -- and you will find there is a ratio of the number of points inside the semi-circle versus the total number thrown, call this ratio x.</p>

<p>Since the area of the square is r times r, you can deduce that the area of the semi circle is x times r times r (that is, x times r squared). Hence x times 4 will give you pi. </p>

<p>This is not a quick method to use. But it's a nice example of a Monte Carlo method. And if you look around, you may find that many problems otherwise outside your computational skills can be solved by such methods.</p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" {<br>#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;<br>// include other similarly non-compliant header files<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>Basically, anytime where a C++ program wants to link to C-based facilities, the <code>extern ""C""</code> is vital. In practical terms, it means that the names used in external references will not be mangled, like normal C++ names would. <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/mixing-c-and-cpp.html"">Reference.</a></p>","13","","13","Chris Jester-Young","2008-08-01 13:54:25","2008-08-01 13:54:25","","","","0","","",""

Try looking at Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and other well known PHP-based CMS's to see how their API hooks look and feel. This way you can even get ideas you may have not thought of previously to make things a little more rubust.</p>

<p>A more direct answer would be to write general files that they would ""include_once"" into their file that would provide the usability they would need. This would be broken up into categories and NOT provided in one MASSIVE ""hooks.php"" file. Be careful though, because what ends up happening is that files that they include end up having more and more dependencies and functionality improves. Try to keep API dependencies low.

<p>For this example source code, you must declare all your plugins before the actual source code that you want to be extendable.  I've included an example of how to handle single or multiple values being passed to the plugin.  The hardest part of this is writing the actual documentation which lists what arguments get passed to each hook.</p>

<p>This is just one method of accomplishing a plugin system in PHP.  There are better alternatives, I suggest you check out the WordPress Documentation for more information.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if there is a way to upgrade the version of Eclipse Aptana that is built against to 3.3.0? Or if there is some other way to get Subclipse to work with the very newest version of Subversion?</p>

But you have bigger problems. <code>gettimeofday()</code> can result in incorrect timings if there are processes on your system that change the timer (ie, ntpd). On a ""normal"" linux, though, I believe the resolution of <code>gettimeofday()</code> is 10us. It can jump forward and backward and time, consequently, based on the processes running on your system. This effectively makes the answer to your question no.</p>

<p>You should look into <code>clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)</code> for timing intervals. It suffers from several less issues due to things like multi-core systems and external clock settings.</p>
